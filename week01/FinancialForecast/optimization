Future Val = Present Val Ã— (1 + rate) ^ years


Optimization of Recursive Financial Forecasting
1. Time and Space Complexity
The recursive approach has O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of years.

It also uses O(n) space due to the function call stack, which may lead to stack overflow for large n.

2. Tail Recursion
Tail recursion is a form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function.

It can be optimized by some compilers to avoid adding new stack frames.

However, Java does not perform tail call optimization, so it doesn't reduce stack usage in practice.

3. Iterative Approach
A loop-based (iterative) version is more efficient in Java for this type of calculation.

It avoids recursion altogether, reducing space complexity to O(1).
